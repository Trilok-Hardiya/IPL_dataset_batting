Project title: IPL dataset analysis(batting_side)

This project analyzes IPL batting data, focusing on top run scorers and strike rates across seasons. 
Key visualizations include bar charts for top run scorers, a pie chart for total runs per season, and a pair plot for player comparisons. 
Insights highlight trends in player performance, revealing patterns in runs scored and strike rates. Future analyses could explore player comparisons and performance metrics to enhance team strategies.

In creating the IPL batting data analysis project, we utilized several Python libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, including data cleaning and aggregating statistics.
Matplotlib: For creating bar charts, line charts, and pie charts to visualize the data.
Seaborn: To create attractive pair plots for visualizing relationships between playersâ€™ statistics.

These tools allowed for comprehensive insights into player performance across IPL seasons.
